# Requirements Tools
1. Features for tools
    - Elicitation
    - Documentation
    - Modeling
    - Management (store, retrieve, prioritize, trace, etc.)
    - Validation (simulators, model checkers, NLP tools, etc.)
1. Support levels for tools
    - General Purpose
        * Word processors
        * Spreadsheet tools
        * Graphical drawing tools
    - Database-level
        * For requirement management
    - Language and Method-based
        * Tools for specific languages (e.g. drawing state machine diagrams)
        * Tools that support specific methods (e.g. validation using model checking)



# RE under Time Pressure
1. General Tips
    - Risk-oriented specification: effort for requirement is determined by risk, not by available time
    - Specify risky stuff in detail, the rest - coarsely
    - Use incremental processes
    - Don't strive for perfection
1. What is indispensable? (cannot be neglected)
    - Know and involve critical stakeholders
    - Know the problem
    - Identify the key goals
    - Define the key terms in a glossary
    - Identify and document
        * main functions and use cases
        * critical quality requirements, constraints and risks
    - Identify critical domain assumptions and constraints
1. What makes thinks harder?
    - High complexity of domain
    - Team is not familiar with domain
    - Many stakeholders
    - Distributed development and/or stakeholders
    - Long cycle time (takes longer to get feedback)
    - Safety-critical requirements (need to really make sure that they are met)
    - High project risks
