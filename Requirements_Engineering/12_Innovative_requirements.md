# Idea
1. Don't just satisfy stakeholders
    - Kano's model helps identify aspects
        * dissatisfiers = implicitly expected
        * satisfiers = explicitly expected
        * innovative requirements = stakeholders don't know it, but would delight them
1. How to come up with them?
    - Encourage out-of-the-box thinking
        * Stimulate the stakeholders' creativity
            + Imagine/make up scenarios for possible futures
            + Imagine a world with no constraints or regulations
            + Find and explore metaphors
            + Study other domains
        * Involve solution experts: explore possibilities with current and future technologies
        * Involve smart people (without domain knowledge)
