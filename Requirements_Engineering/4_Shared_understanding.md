# Observations
1. Specifying everything explicitly is impossible and unfeasible
1. Explicit specifications can be misunderstood
1. RE deals with shared understanding
    - How do we establish it?
    - How can we rely on it?



# Types of shared understanding
# TODO: image
1. Explicit / Implicit = does it need to be written down or said or not
1. True / False = Do all stakeholders have sufficiently similar idea
1. Relevant / Irrelevant = Is it relevant to the product
1. "Dark" = Nobody knows if some information is relevant or not
1. Examples: Traffic light
    - Implicit: red light = stop signal
    - Explicit: The stop signal shall be represented using a red light
    - False implicit misunderstanding:
        * Stakeholders: go = green or yellow flashing
        * Developers: go = green
    - False explicit misunderstanding:
        * Requirement: there should be a yellow flashing light
        * Stakeholders: with red on the other side
        * Developers: with yellow flashing on the other side
    - Explicit shared, irrelevant:
        * The color of the box which holds the control computer
        * Specifying dark green yields irrelevant information
    - Dark information:
        * Legal constraint that no flashing yellow with red on other side
        * Nobody is aware of it
1. Paraphrasing:
    - P1: Achieving shared understanding by explicit specifications as far as needed
    - P2: Relying on implicit shared understanding of relevant information as far as possible
    - P3: Determining the optimal amount of explicit specifications
        * i.e. striking a proper balance between the cost and benefit
1. Cost and benefit
