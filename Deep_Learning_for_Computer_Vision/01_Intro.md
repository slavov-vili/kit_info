# Computer Vision basics
mage](/image](images//
1. Classic approach
mage](/image](images//
    - Image -> Feature Extraction -> Classification
mage](/image](images//
    - Features = colors, edges, optical flow
mage](/image](images//
    - Classification = Machine Learning

# Machine Learning in Computer Vision
mage](/image](images//
1. Classification = What is this object?
mage](/image](images//
1. ^ + Localization = What and where is the object?
mage](/image](images//
1. Object Detection = Recognize multiple classes of objects
mage](/image](images//
1. Instance Segmentation = detect objects and differentiate instances

# Deep Neural Network
mage](/image](images//
1. Basics
mage](/image](images//
    - Input layer -> N Hidden layers -> Output layer
mage](/image](images//
    - Fully connected neurons between layers
mage](/image](images//
    - Each neuron weights the input
mage](/image](images//

1. Process
mage](/image](images//
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
mage](/image](images//
    - Backpropagation
mage](/image](images//
    - Error function minimization
mage](/image](images//

mage](/image](images//
1. Explanations
mage](/image](images//
    - Deep, because each layer seems small part of previous layer (preserves locality)
mage](/image](images//
    - Each layer learns more high-level (complex) features

# Pros and Cons of Deep Learning
mage](/image](images//
1. Pros
mage](/image](images//
    - Good performance for many problems
mage](/image](images//
    - Straightforward architecture
mage](/image](images//
    - Reasonable training times (on GPUs)
mage](/image](images//
    - Human-like behavior
mage](/image](images//

mage](/image](images//
1. Cons
mage](/image](images//
    - Need DATA!
mage](/image](images//
    - Need GPUs!
mage](/image](images//
    - Slower inference than decision trees
mage](/image](images//
    - Difficult to integrate
mage](/image](images//
    - Difficult to debug
