How do you prevent buffer overflows?

1. A basic solution would be to be careful with the order of variable declarations. (i.e. putting buffers at the end)
In this way, control flow which depends on the non-buffer values would be more difficult to influence using buffer overflows
(e.g. in exercise 2, we would not be able to overwrite the value of local_c using buffer overflow).



2. A better solution is to only read the amount of bytes which would fit into the buffer. In c: use fgets with the buffer size
instead of gets.
