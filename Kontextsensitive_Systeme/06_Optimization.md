1. Bayesian Optimization
    - Regressor which takes cross-validation result on the samples 

1. Evolutionary Algorithms
    - Init -> Evaluate -> Assign Fitness -> Select -> Reproduce -> Evaluate -> ...
    - Don't always choose best - need diversity
    - TPOT

1. Neuro Evolution

1. Reinforcement Learning
    - Use a NN to train another NN
    - FUSE Algorithm

1. Blackbox vs Multi-Fidelity
    - Successive Halfing
