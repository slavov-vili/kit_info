# Short History of Economics
1. Definitions
    - Neo-classical Theory
        * The economic problem of society is how to allocate given resources
    - Market
        * A mechanism for resource allocation where supply and demand meet
    - Price Mechanism
        * Market price evolves through interaction between supply and demand
    - Main contribution of neo-classical theory:
        * The market will take care of resource allocation if permitted to do so

1. Neo-classical Theory assumes Perfect Markets
    - Utility maximization of consumers
    - Profit maximization of suppliers
    - Homogeneous goods
    - No personal or time preferences
    - Perfect transparency of markets
    - No transaction costs
    - Immediate response of market participants

1. Hayek's Critique
    - The economic problem is instead of optimization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality.
    - Markets communicate private knowledge efficiently
        * Information aggregation and dissemination



# Origin and Function of Institutions
1. Institutions
    - Humanly devised constraints which structure political, economic and social interaction
    - Consist of informal constraints, formal rules and the enforcement characteristics of both
    - Give order to social life
        * Order = the elements of a system remain in a recognizable and predictable interrelationship
        * Order reduces transaction costs
    - Prescribe a behavior
    - Example: Standard Form for Contract

    - Formal Institutions 
        * Written rules
        * Form the basis for enforcement
        * Violations are enforced by authority according to plannen sanctions
        * Authority is **not** limited to the government

    - Informal Institutions
        * Usually not written (at most partially)
        * Enforcement not specified in advance
        * Spontaneous societal feedback *punishes* the violators
    
    - Conscious Design
        * Constructivist Epistemology (from Descartes)
            + all worthwhile social institutions were and should be created by conscious deductive processes of human reason
        * Society has a function independent of the individual agents
        * This social goal is achieved when the individuals are coordinated

    - Spontaneous Order (Hayek's Catallaxy)
        * Insitutions are formed as a result of a cultural-evolutionary process based on which institution can best solve the coordination problem
        * Only spontaneity can recognize and embody the dynamic flux in the environments and the inadequacy of the agents' knowledge



# Market Engineering
1. Definition
    - Comprises the
        * structured, systematic and theoretically founded procedure
        * of analyzing, designing, introducing and quality assuring
        * of (electronic) market platforms as well as their legal framework
    - simultaneously regarding their
        * market mechanisms and trading rules,
        * systems, platforms, media rules,
        * business models and rules
