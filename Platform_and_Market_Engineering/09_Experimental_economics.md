1. Theory and Empiricism (TODO: image)
1. What is an Experiment?
    - Active engagement with the world which creates an otherwise non-existing learning opportunity
    - Properties
        * Structured examination
        * Base on predefined questions
        * Done in controlled conditions
        * Consist of a predefined set of events
        * Are observable
        * Are decisions of human actors
1. Why?
    - Economics is observational
        * natural data fails to provide critical tests for theoretical propositions
    - Problems: distinguishing historical events occur by chance and are often affected by extraneous factors
        * This gets worse as theories become more complex and precise
    - Econometrics
        * Statistical study of uncontrolled field data
        * difficult to exclude nuisance data
    - Experimental economics
        * systematic evaluation of theories
        * under controlled lab conditions
        * Examples: auctions, negotiations, voting schemes, etc.
1. Principles
    - Controlled institutions
        * Game rules controlled by experimenter
    - Controlled economic environment
        * General policies for conducting experiments
        * Induced Value Theory
1. Advantages
    - Replicability: Instructions are usually published
    - Control: Conditions can be manipulated to evaluate alternate theories
    - Manipulation: Independent variables can be manipulated
1. Types of experiments
    - Tests of behavioral hypotheses
        * 1:1 replication
        * Often theory falsification
    - Theory stress testing
        * Bridging the gap between theory and natural markets
        * Testing the sensitivity of simplifying assumptions
    - Searching for empirical regularities
        * Verification of empirical findings
        * Little or no error in experimental data
1. Correlation and causality (TODO: image)
1. Dos and Don'ts
    - Dos
        * Pay subjects
        * Find subjects with low opportunity costs and high learning curves
        * Create simplest possible environment (Salience)
        * Maintain privacy of subjects
    - Dont's
        * Avoid loaded words in instructions
        * Tell realistic story, but avoid parallels to real life
        * Don't deceive subjects
        * Avoid nuisances
1. Limitations
    - Do economics students act the same as professionals?
    - Experiments too simple to explain real life?
    - Will a working theory also work in real life?
    - Technical difficulties in controlling lab environments
    - Only a supplement, not a replacement



# Induced Value Theory
1. Definition
    - Proper use of reward medium to incentivise subjects
1. Conditions
    - Monotonicity
        * Students would rather have more reward medium than less
        * Achieved using domestic currency
    - Salience
        * The reward is determined by the subject's actions
    - Dominance
        * Changes in the subject's utility to the experiment mainly come from the reward medium
        * Privacy protection: Subjects often care about others' rewards
1. The experimenter
    - can freely choose a relationship between intrinsically worthless object and the reward medium
    - should explain the relationship clearly (salience)
    - achieve monotonicity
    - make sure there are no other influences (dominance)



# Influencing Variables
1. Types
    - Focus variables
        * independent
        * influence the examined (dependent) variable
        * if systematically varied -> treatment variable
    - Confounding variables
        * Also influence the examined variable
        * Need to be taken out of the equation
1. Prominent Confounding variables
    - Learning:
        * Subjects learn during the experiment
        * Should be considered in the analysis
    - Experience:
        * Subjects have different experience levels
        * Controlled for at the sampling
    - Boredom/Exhaustion:
        * Behavior is highly influence by them -> results can be falsified
        * Experiments not longer than 2h
    - Uncontrolled contact:
        * Avoid discussions between participants
        * May result in collusive behavior
    - Self-selection:
        * Need large subject pool
        * Use a random selection process
        * Make sure participants don't take part in similar experiments (using ID)
    - Representative participants:
        * Control for personality traits
1. How to deal with influencing variables
    - Control as many as possible. Costly, but essential for a good experiment
    - Effect of focus variables can be best analyzed as treatment variables
    - Keep all confounding variables stable
    - If confounding variables may affect the focus ones - treat them like treatment ones
    - Vary treatment variables independent of each other



# Neuro-Information-Systems (Neuro-IS)
1. Definition
    - Using IS to measure physiological data
    - Live Biofeedback



# Auction Experiments
1. Theory vs Real life
    - Clock speed in a Dutch auction introduces pressure and alters behavior
