# Short History of Economics
1. Definitions
    - **Market = Supply & Demand**
    - Neo-classical Theory
        * The economic problem of society is how to allocate given resources
    - Market
        * A mechanism for resource allocation where supply and demand meet
    - Price Mechanism
        * Market price evolves through interaction between supply and demand
    - Main contribution of neo-classical theory:
        * The market will take care of resource allocation if permitted to do so
1. Neo-classical Theory assumes Perfect Markets
    - Utility maximization of consumers
    - Profit maximization of suppliers
    - Homogeneous goods
    - No personal or time preferences
    - Perfect transparency of markets
    - No transaction costs
    - Immediate response of market participants
1. Hayek's Critique
    - The economic problem is instead of optimization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality.
    - Markets communicate private knowledge efficiently
        * Information aggregation and dissemination



# Origin and Function of Institutions
1. Institutions
    - **Market = Supply & Demand + Institutions**
    - Humanly devised constraints which structure political, economic and social interaction
    - Consist of informal constraints, formal rules and the enforcement characteristics of both
    - Give order to social life
        * Order = the elements of a system remain in a recognizable and predictable interrelationship
    - Example: Standard Form for Contract
        * Order reduces transaction costs
        * Institutions prescribe a behavior
    - No need for costly information and enforcement activities

    - Formal Institutions
        * Written rules
        * Form the basis for enforcement
        * Violations are enforced by authority according to planned sanctions
        * Authority is **not** limited to the government
    - Informal Institutions
        * Usually not written (at most partially)
        * Enforcement not specified in advance
        * Spontaneous societal feedback **punishes** the violators
    - Conscious Design
        * Constructivist Epistemology (from Descartes)
            + all social institutions should be created by conscious deductive processes of human reason
        * Society has a function independent of the individual agents
        * This social goal is achieved when the individuals are coordinated
    - Spontaneous Order (Hayek's Catallaxy)
        * The Institution which can best solve the coordination problem is formed (cultural-evolutionary)
        * Only spontaneity can solve the dynamic environment and inadequacy of agents' knowledge



# Market Engineering
1. Definition
    - The procedure of analyzing, designing and introducing (electronic) market platforms and their legal frameworks
        * structured, systematic and theoretically founded
    - simultaneously regarding their
        * market mechanisms and trading rules,
        * systems, platforms, media rules,
        * business models and rules
