1. Questions
    - Why performance not sufficient for biases?
        * Gives no info about used features: which, how, what effect
    - Intrinsic vs post-hoc interpretability
        * Different approaches
        * Intrinsic = try to understand the model
        * Post-hoc = try to understand outcome?
        * Smaller model vs bigger/complex model
