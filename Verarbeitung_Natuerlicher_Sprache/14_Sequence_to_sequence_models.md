    - Language is ambiguous (bank)
    - Different information in source and target
        * Lexical mismatch: fish -> pez (living in the water), pezcado (caught)
        * Less information -> More information
    - Same information in source and target
        * Structural divergence: Word order (a delicious soup -> una sopa deliciosa)
        * Categorical divergence: Noun -> Adjective
    - Co-reference
        * Anaphora: pronouns (he, she, it)
        * Deictic reference: here, now, I
        * Using synonyms, hyponyms
    - Changes over time
        * New words: Brexit
        * Borrowed words: download, gedownloaded
        * Social media: tmr
