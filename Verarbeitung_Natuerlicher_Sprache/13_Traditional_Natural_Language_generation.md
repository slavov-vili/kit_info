# Dialog Modeling
1. Overview
    - Classic Components of a (Spoken) Dialog System
        * TODO: image
    - Dialog Manager
        * Manages the flow of conversation
        * Input = semantic representation of the input (generated by the NLU)
        * Output = semantic representation of the output
        * Utilize additional knowledge
            + User info
            + Dialog history
            + Task-specific info
    - Challenges
        * Errors propagate through components
        * Need to find unambiguous representation
        * Hard to train on data (need specific data)
1. Types of Dialog
    - Goal-oriented Dialog
        * Follow a fixed set of goals (e.g. ticket vending machine, restaurant reservation)
        * Aim: reach the goal in as few steps as possible
    - Social Dialog
        * Conversational Bots
        * Most human
        * Small Talk conversation
        * Aims
            + generate interesting, coherent, meaningful responses
            + converse as long as possible
            + be a companion
1. Dialog Systems
    - Initiatives
        * System
            + Command and control
            + System prompts user for input
            + Example: S: What do you want to do? You can do x,y,z. U: I want x. S: Where do you want to go?
        * Mixed
            + Most natural
            + Both System and User can start interaction
        * User
            + 
    - Confirmation
        * Strategies for verifying/confirming information
        * Prompt: I want to go to X.
        * Explicit: Did you mean Y?
        * Implicit: When do you want to leave Y?
        * Alternative: Did you mean X or Y?
    - Development
        * TODO: image
    - Components
        * Dialog Model
            + Information about the system
            + Initiative, confirmation, kind of actions
        * User Model
            + Beliefs about stuff
            + User knowledge, expertise, experience
        * Knowledge Base
            + Information about the world and domain
        * Discourse Context
            + Information about dialog history and discourse



# Rule-based Systems
1. Types
    - Finite state
    - Frame-based
    - Agent-based
1. Finite State-based systems
    - TODO: image
    - Idea: iterate through states that define actions
    - Dialog flow
        * TODO: explain
    - Advantages
        * TODO: explain
    - Disadvantages
        * TODO: explain
1. Frame-based systems
